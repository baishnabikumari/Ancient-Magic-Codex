## How It Works

- All the cards on the **Home Page** is fully generated by using the `items` and the array in `script.js`.
- When you Click on a card :
  - JS saves that item’s data in `localStorage`.
  - .html will take you to a specific `.html` page (like `lantern.html` or `sword.html` and more .html files).
- The detail(.html) page loads that magic item’s information, color theme, and description with a png of that magic item.

---

## Styling Notes

All pages has a unified **magical theme**:
- **Fonts:** Clean and uses google fonts.
- **Backgrounds:** Each Magic item has a glowing aura.
- **Cards:** shadows and hover effect.
- **Responsive:** Cards auto fit to screen Because the width is set to 90% for images.

## JavaScript Highlights

Here is the main keyframe from `script.js`:

```js
const nameToFile = {
  "Lantern of Souls": "lantern.html",
  "Crystal of Serenity": "crystal.html",
  "Wand of Wisdom": "wand.html",
  "Potion of Shadows": "potion.html",
  "Sword of Flames": "sword.html",
  "Cloak of Mist": "cloak.html",
  "Orb of Echoes": "orb.html",
  "Helm of Valor": "helm.html",
  "Boots of Wind": "boots.html",
  "Ring of Eternity": "ring.html",
  "Staff of Storms": "staff.html",
  "Amulet of Dawn": "amulet.html",
};

window.location.href = nameToFile[item.name] || "item.html";
```

These lines of code ensure and will open a seprate page for all the items

## Adding New Items

If you want to add your own magical creation:

1. So you have to add a new object in the `items` array inside `script.js`:
   ```js
   { name: "Crown of Twilight", desc: "Rules both night and day.", color: "violet", img: "assets/crown.png" },
   ```
2. Add a new file in the root `crown.html`.
3. Link it in the `nameToFile` map.
4. And at last add your css if required and make sure about you jS.

All good - now the item is added and you can see it on live server if you want.
